			<h1>About This Website</h1>
			<p>The website was made by Skelebrine (or Skelebrinium) to display news about the new server I am in.
				This website was coded manually, with many lines of code from many different files.
				The entire website's code is on GitHub publicly.
				Updates to the website will be done periodically, mostly adding more to the site.
			</p>
			<h2>The Download Page doesn't have anything yet. It will be an archive of the many different versions.</h2>
